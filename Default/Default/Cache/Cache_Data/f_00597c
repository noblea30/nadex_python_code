*\n * 1. Provide high-level query performance measurements for monitoring purposes.\n * 2. Provide detailed profiling information to assess the performance of particular queries.\n * 3. Provide detailed logging to debug query evaluation (particularly conditional expressions).\n *\n * The above goals should be achieved without violating nonfunctional requirements:\n *\n * 1. The presence / abscence of tracing information should not affect existing SDK / API interfaces.\n * 2. Tracing should not become a significant burden on resources.\n *\n * # What's in a trace?\n *\n * As a query is executed, events occur which can leave a record in the trace.\n * Examples of events are 'Execute this query', or 'save this string to the trace log'.\n * For each of these events, it's important to know what happened, and exactly when it occurred.\n *\n * JS provides two timers: a millisecond resolution timestamp, and a much more precise\n * relative timer (typically with 5 microsecond resolution measured from page load / node process start).\n * Events in the trace log contain both timestamps.\n *\n * So traces are essentially collections of timestamped events.\n *\n * # Contexts\n *\n * It often makes sense to group events which belong to a common operation.\n * For example, tracing a conditional expression which 'OR's together two graphql queries could be confusing\n * if events occuring during the execution of the two graphql queries were mixed together.\n *\n * Instead, each query gets it's own context. Events which occur as a result of the query's execution are\n * recorded within the context. If the query's execution requires another query to be evaluated (for example\n * as a value passed into the graphql query), then the sub-query will get it's own context.\n *\n *\n */\n\ntype MaybeArray<T> = T | T[];\n\nexport enum TraceEventType {\n  RootContext = 'rootContext',\n  QueryContext = 'queryContext',\n  TraceMessage = 'traceMessage',\n}\n\nexport interface TraceTimestamp {\n  abs: number;
